Mission
Our non-profit organization is a resource for our military personnel to start a career in healthcare.


Unemployed Veterans
Many U.S. Veterans find it hard to secure a job in healthcare when they’re ready to 
work in the civilian world. Even after showing dedication, strong work ethic, and 
leadership while serving our country, many military members can’t find jobs.

453,000 unemployed veterans in 2016
Post-Sept. 11 veterans tend to be unemployed at higher rates than other veterans


Message from the President
I started Heroes for Healthcare to help our U.S. military personnel receive the resources 
and credentials they need to continue their career in healthcare as a civilian.

We need supporters like you to help our mission so our service members can get a job and better 
their lives.

After all they did for us, supporting this organization seems like the right thing to do.
Make a difference today by supporting Heroes for Healthcare.
